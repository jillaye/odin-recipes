        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 350°F. In a small bowl, mix the sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and cloves.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs to blend. Stir in the pumpkin purée and sugar-spice mixture. Gradually stir in the evaporated milk.</li>
            <li>Pour into glass or ceramic baking dish. A good thing to know is that you can fill a baking dish deeper than a pie crust, but it’s best not to exceed a depth of about 1½ inches. Baking times vary with the depth, size, and type of baking dish, so you just have to watch and check. Bake until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let cool on wire rack, then refrigerate overnight, until ready to serve. Serve with the whipped cream, if using.</li>
