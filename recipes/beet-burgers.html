                <li>1 onion</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cup rolled oats</li>
                <li>7 ounce feta cheese</li>
                <li>1 handful fresh basil, leaves picked</li>
                <li>1 pinch sea salt and black pepper</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel and grate beets, onion, and garlic on a box grater or use a food processor with the grating blades attached.</li>
                <li>Place the grated vegetables in a large mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Add olive oil, eggs, and rolled oats and mix everything well.</li>
                <li>Add cheese, basil, salt, and pepper and stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Set aside for about 30 minutes, so the oats can soak up the liquid and the mixture sets (this step is important for the patties to hold together).</li>
                <li>Try shaping a patty with your hands. If the mixture is too loose, add some more oats.</li>
                <li>Form 6 to 8 patties with your hands.</li>
                <li>Grill the burgers a couple of minutes on each side or fry them in a frying pan by heating a knob of coconut oil or ghee and fry until golden on both sides.</li>
                <li>Serve with grilled sourdough bread and toppings of your choice (lettuce, cabbage, mango, avocado, tomatoes, sprouts, and onions).</li>
            </ol>
